		<h1>Time Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. It's important because it helps us to make our algorithms more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> on the other hand, is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs. The term O(n) is used to express the amount of memory space an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.</p>
